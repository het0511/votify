# Votify (Custom Blockchain-Based Voting System)

A secure and transparent online voting application built using a custom blockchain developed in Java (Spring Boot). 
Designed to ensure immutability, prevent double voting, and allow real-time results. This project uses custom/simple blockchain to understand the basic idea of what blockchain's structure is and how it works and how it is secure.
